This article provides details on how interest rates are calculated on DDEX

# Overview

Interest rates on DDEX are dynamic, fluctuating based on supply and demand. The balance of supply and demand is often referred to as the utilization, or the percent of the total lending pool that is being borrowed at any given time.

The interest rates are designed to encourage lending pools to always have funds. If utilization is high, the interest rates will be high to encourage more lenders to supply funds.
